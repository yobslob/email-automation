Hey {Name}, <br><br>

turns out, you don’t open mails from your subscribers :( <br><br>

As I said earlier, Your content is actually high-signal, but the current distribution is likely leaking 70% of your potential audience. You're doing the hard part (the recording), but missing the "visual hook" that stops the scroll.<br>

I’ll be honest, it’s frustrating to see high-level conversations get buried just because the packaging doesn't stop the scroll. You’re doing the heavy lifting of being interesting; the rest shouldn't be your problem.<br><br>

Take a look at the level we're playing at here:
