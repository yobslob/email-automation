Hi {Name}, I was watching your reel "{VideoName}", and I was like—this guy has such a crazy rich man lifestyle which I came to know about from your highlight on {PrimaryPlatform}. It’s not just good, it’s the kind of thing that makes people stop scrolling. Naturally, I checked out your {SecondaryPlatform} and no offense, but I was honestly flabbergasted that I couldn’t find you just by name. When I finally got there through the links, I noticed you haven’t really delved into editing your videos—which is exactly what I help with: - Taking the load of managing and optimizing the account so you can focus on the bigger picture. I see you wanna get into {SecondaryPlatform} to eventually boost your business and build a community. I’ve edited and managed over 650+ videos for people on {SecondaryPlatform} which lets me hear that you don’t deserve {LessSubs} followers—bro, the value you have!! You should be in 100k’s easily, just need the right guy who knows how to edit and set up content for you. So, if you’re curious, just reply to this, and I’ll share the thought—no pressure, just something I think you might find useful. Btw here's work and people we've worked with: <a href="https://binary-growth.vercel.app/">Binary Growth</a> Keep doing what you’re doing, it’s exciting to see where this could go.
